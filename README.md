# lsv
A script to list all runit services within a specified service directory.
## Usage
`lsv [SVDIR]`
Basic output lists each service name, run status, and PID if running on its own line, making lsv very grep friendly.

## Todo
* Add an option to create a pstree-like output for a more visual representation of services.
